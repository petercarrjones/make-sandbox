It is the position of petitioner thrt under the grovisions of the so-called AtoXa Agreeaent, and the suppleclental agreeaents as specifically set 03:. in the petition in this case, that "when the rolls ha2 been sabnitted by the Comaission to and .sI>~roved by the . 
Secretary of the Interiw, the persons whose rimes mere foand there- 
of the Congress thnt 5a;re mypart of the tribal property to persons other than those t3et constituted the embers ship of the tribe as fatad by the Secretary hinself, is a confiscation of the tribcl docsln and 
not a lawful exercise of t'ne plenary and -political poxcr oq the Con~ess.~%is Connission cannot agree with this contention. 
The extensive qyotstions fron the several acts of Congress dealing with the rolls rhich Eire to constitilte the tribal nenbership are made for the pease of sfiowing that Co3gress za6e many chazges 
in enrolling matters subsequent to the act of Jllly 1, 1902 and at all times asserted'its right to cl-ecide, or, set UT)by its authority, 
conqiss ions to decih, tribal membership. Additions to the rolls and extensions sf tine for corqleting the sane mere ma26 by each d 
the acts subsevent tothe act of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. 641) relied

'Dy the Congress of the kited States aqd by the nileabers of the Indian tribes, nevertheless the acts of Congress, as shom in the acts referred to, mmy tines modified and change2 the preoiouslg ratifiec? agree- nents* And in 30 Stzt. $5 it is qecificably provided that Congress

In a later case, that of '!inll~.ce v. A6:.3s, 204 U.S. 415, the 
contention mas nade thst Congress did not hrve the pomr to mezd

Tribes. In that ca.se one Eill had been enrolled pursnmt to 2 Secree

after the act of Ccngess of July 1, 1902 created a Choctaw anc?

Petitioner contends t5at the only thing before the cocrts in 
1 Ind. C1. Comm. 182 

these txo c~scs nzs "whether or not ~2plicants fo? enroblnent en 
the final rolls had a vested si&t in the prxeduse set up for the making of sach rolls." 
%hat is, in effect, the questi~n involved in the cese at bar in that the czntention of petitioner is thet the enrollment made ky virtue of the Atoka Agreenent, the act of Co~gress of June 28, 1898 (39 Stat. 495) ratifying the sme, the supple~ental agreement md &he statnte confimiag the saxe (32 Stat. 641.), gave to the members ensabled threunder the sole right of omershh? of the tribal proper- ty--:~ cther mrds, tfiat such nenbers thereby acquired "a vested sight ir, the psoced=e se9.q for the m&zisg of such rolls. " 
!be athor ized procedwes in the acts of Congress providing for enrolbnent rere the creatures of Congress; axl surely if Congress as state?, in Tallace v. -Adans, 204 Pi. S. 415, can nadcgS cay reason-able ways to ascert?-in wino were e3titled to its rivilegesw (re-ferring to citizenship in the Indfm- tribes) ar-d"if the result of one measure was n~tsatisfactoq-it cocPd try =o t'ner, "hen Congress can do by direct Legis'k tive action what it had authority to create edninistsative agencies to do.

Petitioner contexls that the case of Gritts v. 22b 1J.S.
----Pisbcr, 640, is not in point because that case was not prosecuted by the tribs k.tby three individual neribers in op?osition to the views of the tribe. This fact cozzld nat seen to divest the language cf the court of relevmcy to the case at has, such langlcge being zs f ollo7fs :

Certaicl3- tribal progesty and tribal relations existed in 1914 when, being dissatisfied nith the action of ageccles it had created to Cetemine tbe citizens3ip of the Choctaa tribe, Coagess adopted the procedzre of placbg nmes on the rolls ky direct cocgressfond act.

fn our viem of the law ,gverning the clain, as expressed above, it would make no Cifference ~hether the clal-n here asserted r:as indi-vidual or tribal for in neither case would the Ga-ermer,t be liable, so it is unnecessary to decide the first contention of the defendant, nzmely, that the cl~imis individual arid not tribal. 
The contention of defendmt thzt the e~tof Congress in edLing forty-one n,mes to the Chwtam rolls created no legal clain in favor of the petitioner against the defe~dnnt must be sxstained. 
It is so ordered.
