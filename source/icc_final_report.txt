Preface 
This is the Final Report of the Indian Claims Commission. Reports have been 
issued annually since 1968, but these were for the purpose of showing yearly 
progress. The Final Report is intended to give an expanded picture of the Commis­
sion and its work. In a document limited in extent, a good deal of material has had to 
be ignored or condensed. The intent is to explore briefly the scope ofthe problems 
of Indian claims. To do so we have included a concise history of the Commission. 
It briefly traces the origin of the Indian claims against the United States Govern­
ment and the attempt to resolve them in the Federal Courts; discusses the legisla­
tive history of the Indian Claims Commission Act; and surveys the growth and 
work of the Commission from its inception in August 1946 to its termination in 
September 1978. It is offered as an expanded chronology of legislative and admin­
istrative actions and avoids so far as possible discussion of the substance of the 
Commission's decisions. It does not represent the opinion of the Commission or 
any Commissioner. 
TheCommissionwasafacet in thecenturyanda halfoldprocess ofIndianclaims litigation. It did not create the claims but, in the more than 500 dockets that it decided, it succeeded in mitigating many of the problems which arose as a result of settlement and westward expansion in this country. Hopefully, interested parties will be enlightened with respect to the enormity of the task which faced the Com­mission from its inception. 
To this end, in addition to the historical survey, we have included an alphabetical index and a docket number index to the 617 dockets filed before the Commission. Also, we present a map which delineates the adjudicated land areas of the various Indian tribes. This map is the result of the labor of Commissioner Richard W. Yarborough and is further explained in the Commissioner's own preface to the map. 
We wish to thank those who have applied their time and effort to this work. Dr. Harvey D. Rosenthal wrote the historical survey from his larger study of the sub­ject. Ms. Gail Reizenstein and Mr. John B. Yellott, Jr., law clerks, helped Mr. Donald Hyde compile the two indexes. Ms. Mary Ann Glenn, Ms. Jane Otto, and Ms. Judy Femi worked long on the typing and proofing of the index and the history. Lastly, appreciation should be especially expressed to the Chief Counsel of the Commission, Mr. Harry E. Webb, Jr., the man who sponsored and made it a reality.

Historical Survey 

Indian Grievances, the Government, and the Court of Claims, 1831-1946 
The bases of the Indian claims against the Ameri­
can Government were rooted in what has been 
referred to as the "largest real estate transaction 
in history." As the Indian's possessions receded, his 
claim surfaced. This element of American history 
flowered in the period from the close of the Civil 
War to the First World War and the "wrongs com­
mitted, or at least initiated by our public servants in 
that period give rise to most of the claims that we 
are trying to redress today." 1 
Historical precedent and national policy called for the United States to acquire this land by the legal forum of treaty-making and legislation rather than the simpler method of conquest and confiscation. The separate Indian tribes were considered as sovereign nations during the treaty-making period and in 370 treaties they negotiated away nearly two billion acres of North America, leaving themselves 140 million acres at the end of that period in 1868. (The last treaty was made and ratified in 1868, but the process was not formally ended until 1871 , after which Congressional and Executive "agreements" continued the procedure.) 
Politically, morally, culturally, legally, and philosophically, America had all the tools and ration­alizations it needed to remove the human blocks to her manifest destiny. In his first annual message to Congress in 1817, President James Monroe said: "The earth was given to mankind to support the greatest numbers of which it is capable, and no tribe or people have a right to withhold from the wants of others more than is necessary for their own sup­port and comfort." The frontiersmen had sounded this theme for two centuries, and Monroe, in the tradition of Jefferson, was not remiss in sounding it again for the nineteenth century. The period of greatest westward expansion, 1815 to 1860, saw 260 treaties signed., Two hundred and thirty of all the treaties between 1789 and 1868 involved Indian lands, 76 called for removal and resettlement, and

nearly 100 dealt with boundaries between Indian and white lands primarily. 2 These treaties and other Government agreements embodied 720 land ces­sions from 1784 to 1894. 
By the 1890's, the contest for America was over and its possession signed, sealed, and delivered. But, though the white man was contented with his record in these dealings, the Indian was not. One Western historian has noted that "it would be diffi­cult, indeed, to find a land cession made by the Indians entirely of their own volition."3 The Ameri­can right to buy always superseded the Indian right not to sell. The white man's superior power allowed this policy, and pro forma use of the treaty con­formed to his Anglo-Saxon tradition and concern for the law. For the Indian the legality of it all was of little comfort. 
It was this precise legalistic tradition that necessi­tated the treaty process, but at the same time har­bored the seeds of future redress for inequities in that procedure. Treaties are contracts, and for the land acquired monies and goods were paid or prom­ised. The consequences of this powerful European respect for property are still with us. Thus, the United States, through formal treaty or agreement with the Indian tribes, purchased 95 percent of its public domain for an alleged $800 million. 4 This figure and the treaties mitigate the myth of rude con­quest and dispossession. Jefferson observed two centuries ago that the lands of this country were not taken from the Indians by conquest as is 'so generally supposed. "I find in our historians and records, repeated proofs of purchase, which cover a considerable part of the lower country; and many more would doubtless be found on further search. 
The upper country, we know, has been acquired altogether by purchase made in the most unexcep­tional form."5 Thus the treaties were made and obligations incurred by the United States Govern­ment. The fact that these obligations were often not

wholly met did not negate the law of the land. What the white man chose to forget, the Indian chose to remember; and bided his time. When the fever of conquest subsided, that same legal conscience that necessitated the treaties was used to enforce them. 
The first important attempt of an Indian tribe to test the theory of the white law in the courts rather than its practice on the battlefield came in 1831. The Cherokee Nation had adopted the white man's cul­ture a generation earlier and had made impressive advances along the road to civilization by 1829. The argument that the hunter must naturally give way to the farmer could no longer be applied to these In­dians. But complex historical and political processes and larger issues in the growth ofa new nation over­whelmed the Indian cause and the five civilized tribes faced removal to the West. The Indians sought redress in the Supreme Court but lost on a jurisdic­tional ruling. The Cherokee were declared neither 
foreign nations nor states of the Union within the meaning of Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution and they could not sue, be sued, or intervene in any case where the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was involved.6 
In the mid-1850's, tribal relations with the Govern­ment centered on the 52 treaties negotiated from 1853 to 1857, but some tribes filed their claims with the new Court of Claims. None had come to judg­ment by 1863 when Congress passed an amenda­tory law to the Court's enabling act of 1855 which, among other things, expressly excluded the Indian from the new court. Section 9 of this statute de­claredthatjurisdiction ofthe Court ofClaims"shall not extend to or include any claim against the Government not pending in said court on Decem­ber 1, 1862, growing out of or dependent on any treaty stipulation entered into with foreign nations 
or with the Indian tribes." 7 Thus, the oversight that did not exclude the Indians in 1855 was cor­rected and the Court remained closed to the Indians until 1881, when it was first opened to an individual tribe by a speci~1 jurisdictional act of Congress. 
In 1871, the treaty-making process was formally ended and the fiction of the tribes' "independent nation" status was terminated, but with the proviso that nothing in that act "shall be construed to in­validate or impair the obligations of any treaty here­tofore lawfully made and ratified with any such

Indian nation or tribe. ,. 8 This provision kept the past alive for the Indian claimant and enabled him to persevere in his quest for judicial recognition of his treaty-based land claims" 
With determination, and with the aid of sympa­thetic white allies, the Indian made some legal advances. In the famous Standing Bear v. Crook trial of 1879, the United States District Court of Nebraska, for the first time, established Indians as persons under the terms of the Fourteenth Amend­ment. Out of this case also came an investigation of the South Dakota Poncas' (later of Nebraska) claims and a congressional recognition of the obvi­ous justice of these claims. In January 1881, a presidential commission of investigation expressed its conviction, from the Ponca case, that "it is of the utmost importance to white and red men alike that all Indians should have the opportunity of appealing to the courts for the protection and vindi­cation of their rights of person and property." 9 A door was opened. 
The year 1881 was a turning point in the long his­tory of Indian claims frustration. By a special act of March 1881 the tenacious Choctaws were granted access to the Court of Claims for resolution of their 50-year-old claims. I 0 In the years of Indian exclu­sion from this Court the Indians of the West had followed those of the East to military defeat and confinement. As the last of the hostilities and resis­tance faded, the legal forum was allowed to replace the military arena and the Choctaw precedent broadened this format. It was in this year that a prominent New York attorney, Charles O'Connor, publicly lauded the Court of Claims as the "first­born of a new judicial era." He saw the court as a new principle and as a "practical negative upon that vicious maxim" that the sovereign can do no wrong. "Henceforth our government repudiates the arro­
gant assumption, and consents to meet at the bar of enlightened justice every rightful claimant, how lowly soever his condition may be. "11 After 1881 this would include even the "lowly" Indians, but only by the process of a special jurisdictional act of Congress to open this Court to the petitioning tribes. 
The process of securing a jurisdictional act from Congress to grant access to the Court of Claims was an arduous one. From 1881 to 1890 the tribes filed 11

claims and secured awards on two, but 73 contracts, representing 61 more claims, were approved or pending with the Secretary of Interior. In the years following, to World War I, 20 more claims were filed with the Court and 12 resulted in recoveries totaling $13 million. 12 
The decade following the beginning of World War I was an unprofitable one as far as Indian suc­cess in the Court was concerned, but in those years lay the promise of future victories. From 1914 to 1923 only eight claims cases were referred to the Court of Claims, three of which resulted in awards totaling over $1.5 million. But the Indian response to America's involvement in the War had been enthusi­astic. Thousands joined the service, though not sub­ject to the draft. This motivated a strong movement in Congress and the Executive for a general law to reward them with American citizenship; it was finally passed in 1924. The removal of this cloud over the Indian's legal status, combined with Con­gressional goodwill, resulted in an explosion of claims to redress old injustices. In the next 3 years, after passage of the necessary jurisdictional acts, almost as many claims cases were filed in the Court of Claims (37) as were filed in the 42 years before citizenship (39). But it was not the legal enactment of citizenship alone that led to the increase in In­dian claims. It was the increase in public awareness of Indian patriotism that heightened the willingness 
in Congress to pass the jurisdictional acts opening the Court to the Indians. In total, by 1946, almost 200 claims were filed with the Court of Claims; but only 29 received awards, while the bulk of the rest were dismissed on technicalities which led to action for revised jurisdictional acts. Obviously, if some­thing was to be done with these claims, a new proce­dure was necessary. 
The Evolution of the Indian Claims Com­mission, 192846 
The Court of Claims, narrowly circumscribed by the acts granting it jurisdiction, tried for 65 years to deal conclusively with Indian claims and failed. The Government, the Indians, and impartial re­searchers all deemed the machinery related to this process to be inadequate. The result of the almost unanimous dissatisfaction was the establishment of a special commission to handle exclusively Indian cases under a broad new jurisdiction and with the firmly expressed goal of finality.

The evolution of the Indian Claims Commission 
Act of 1946 was a long process in the context of 
American history. The first influential person to 
take up this theme in the twentieth century was 
Francis E. Leupp, Commissioner of Indian Affairs 
from 1905 to 1908. In his book, The Indian and His 
Problem (1910), Leupp recommended "the creation 
of a special court, or the addition of a branch to the 
present United States Court of Claims, to be charged 
with the adjudication of Indian claims exclusively." 13 
In 1913, in hearings before a subcommittee of the 
House Committee on Indian Affairs, Assistant Com­
missioner of Indian Affairs Edgar B. Meritt came to 
the conclusion that an investigatory commission 
should be established to sort out the Indian claims 
and prepare reports upon which basis Congress 
could dispose of the cases for all time. 14 
In 1928, with the publication of The Problems of Indian Administration (the Meriam Report), the concept of an Indian Claims Commission received the endorsement that was to carry it into law some 18 years later. This work was done under the general direction of Lewis Meriam of the Institute for Government Research in Washington, D.C. at the request of the Secretary of the Interior, Hubert Work. The Report called for a "special commis­sion" to study the existing claims still without a jurisdictional act. It proposed that this commission should submit recommendations to the Secretary of Interior "so that those claims which are meri­torious may be submitted to Congress with a draft of a suitable bill authorizing their settlement before the Court of Claims. "15 
Congressional Indian Committees had, since 1924, expressed an interest in this concept. In response, the Institute for Government Research, in the fall of 1929, retained Nathan R. Margold, a New York attorney, to study Indian claims problems and to draft a bill for their solution. After a thorough study of the issues and people involved, Margold reported to the Senate Subcommittee on Indian Affairs in December 1930. He proposed that Congress create an Indian Claims Commission of six commissioners to hear and finally decide all claims within a 15 year period.,16 Nothing came of the Margold study but, also in 1930, Chairman of the House Committee on Indian Affairs, Scott Leavitt of Montana, had introduced a bill (H.R.

7963) to create a United States Court of Indian Claims. This court was to consist of three judges, have a 5-year filing period for all claims founded upon the Constitution, laws of Congress, treaties, and contracts, and render final decisions within a to-year life span. Thus, by 1930, the resolution of the Indian claims was proposed under two forms of tribunal. 
In 1934and early 1935, theproponents ofan Indian court submitted two more bills to establish an Indian Claims Court. Both bills were ignored, largely be­cause they were not, by this time, considered practi­cal answers to the claims situation. In a report to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes argued against them and directed the Seantors' attention to a bill recently introduced in the House to create an Indian Claims Commission instead of a court, which he considered preferable. 
With the introduction, in March 1935, of H.R. 6655, an act to create an Indian Claims Commission, the legislative movement to expedite Indian claims shifted irreversibly from the consideration of a judicial to a commission format. Both Congress and the Secretary of Interior now felt that a commission rather than an adversary proceeding could better "cut through" the red tape of Government agencies charged with the preparation of Indian cases. An investigatory commission appeared to be a better vehicle for "claims involving history and anthro­pology as much as law." 17 This bill, and three simi­lar ones, aroused a good deal of debate throughout the 1930's, but no legislation resulted. 
The final phase of the quest for claims legislation began on August 1, 1940, with the introduction of 
S. 4234. Unlike all previous bills it gave the com­mission authority to make final determinations of the claims on matters of fact and law. Review on questions of law was allowed by certiorari to the Court of Claims. Its jurisdiction was to embrace all outstanding tribal claims of a legal, equitable, or moral nature presented within a 5 year limit. The commission had thus matured from a fact··finding advisory body to a self-contained agency able to conduct its own investigations, determine the facts, adjudicate the legal issues, and make a final deter­mination. Congress, of course, still had final review when it received the complete report on each case. 
This bill met many of the problems of Indian claims but it still did not grant the commission the power to deal finally with the claims in its own right. 
l1Vine Deloria. Jr (ed), Behind the Trail ofBroken Trealies (Ne,-" York: Delacorte 
Press. 1974),221 

The Interior Department then presented its own bill 
(S. 4349) to close this gap. Commissioner of Indian Affairs John Collier correctly sawfinality as the key to Government acceptance of any claims format. He also stressed this need in order to give' 'meaning" to the 1940 platform declarations of the two major parties, both of which called for final settlement. 18 
The intervention of World War II silenced most of the debate on Indian claims temporarily but in 1944 the final push for the establishment of a commission began. Reworked versions of the earlier bills were presented and the Congress showed a revived in­terest in dealing with this issue. 
The most extensive hearings of these bills to date were held in five sessions over a 4 month period in 1945. Representative Henry M. Jackson of Washing­ton, Chairman of the House Committee on Indian Affairs, was determined to act favorably upon H.R. 1198 or one similar in purpose. Chairman Jackson's perception of that purpose was clear: "We are being harassed constantly by various pieces of legisla­tion," he said, "and we plan to dispose of all those routine claims and let the Commission decide what the obligation is of this Government to the Indians ... and appropriate the money .... I think that is our congressional intent. "19 On this there was near unanimous agreement among the witnesses at the hearings. 
On October 25, 1945, Chairman Jackson intro­duced H.R. 4497, the embodiment of many of the ideas contained in the several bills since 1935. The bill's jurisdiction was to include moral claims based on "unconscionable consideration" and "fair and honorable dealings" as well as those over which the Court of Claims then had jurisdiction. In its report, the Committee on Indian Affairs stated that the bill was "primarily designed to right a continuing wrong to our Indian citizens for which no possible justifi­cation can be asserted." The report noted that In­dians were rewarded with citizenship for patriotism following World War I and that it was "only fitting" that this same quality was again rewarded by the removal of the "last serious discrimination with which they are burdened in their dealings with the federal Government." Hereafter, the Court of Claims would be open to Indians and end the need 
to accord special treatment to their claims. But it was thought advisable, concluded the report, to

establish the commission to deal with the backlog of cases accumulated over the 82 years Indians had been denied equal access to the courts. The bill easily passed the House and, after a conference and minor alterations, the Senate on August 2, 1946. 
There was yet the hurdle of presidential approval but little trouble was expected and none materi­alized. Secretary of Interior Julius A. Krug wrote that H.R. 4497 was "certainly the most important Indian legislation enacted in more than a decade," and that it would "strengthen our moral position in the eyes of many other minority peoples" in little nations abroad. His prepared statement for Presi­dent Truman read, in part, as follows: 
The bill makes perfectly clear what many men and women, here and abroad, have failed to recognize. that in our trans­actions with the Indian tribes we have at least since the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 set for ourselves the standard of fair and honorable dealings, pledging respect for all Indian property rights.. Instead ofconfiscating Indian lands, we have purchased from the tribes that once owned this continent more than 90 percent of our public domain, pay­ing them approximately 800 million dollars in the process. It would be a miracle if in the course of these dealings-the largest real estate transaction in history-we had not made some mistakes and occasionally failed to live up to the pre­cise terms of our treaties and agreements with some 200 tribes., But we stand ready to submit all such controversies to the judgment of impartial tIibunals, We stand ready to 
correct any mistakes we have made.,20 
The passage of the Indian Claims Commission Act capped 16 years of intensive campaigning for an idea almost half a century old. This struggle involved ardent friends of the Indian on one side, vigorous defenders of the Government on the other, and many sincere middlemen who tried to serve justice as they saw it. To the credit of Congress, the moral issues were openly faced and debated. This debate engen­dered much divisiveness but the substantial prob­lems were finally overcome or compromised and the moral issues recognized by the Act along with the purely legal and financial considerations. The final and just resolution of the tribal claims was a pro­
jected hope and, though the legislators planned that one decade would bring results rather than three, their ideal, in context, was not unrealistic. 
The Indian Claims Commission: The Form­alive Decade, 1947-1957 
The Indian Claims Commission, created on August 13, 1946, was finally constituted when its three appointed members were sworn in on April 10, 
10public Papers oj'the President of the U,r;led Scau.s, Harry S I'ruman. 1946 (Washington D C 196:).414 
1947. President Truman named as assistant Com­missioners Louis J. O'Marr, an ex-Attorney General of Wyoming and William M. Holt, a Nebraska lawyer. As Chief Commissioner he appointed Edgar 
E. Witt, a former Lieutenant Governor of Texas. Witt had been appointed chairman of two Mexican Claims Commissioners by President Roosevelt and the second had ended its work in 1947. 
The Commission began its first full fiscal year of 
operation in July 1947. It was authorized 23 em­
ployees but employed only 12 that first year. It had 
already adopted its rules of procedure and had sent 
notice to most Indian groups in June., By the end of 
the calendar year, 17 claims were filed for an aggre­
gate amount of $253 millionY 
In 1948 the Commissioners estimated that any­
where from 200 to 500 claims would be filed. 22 The 
cases came in slowly over most of the 5-year filing 
period and, with 200 in by early 1951, the Com­
missioners thought that 300 would be the total. Also, 
by this time, 25 cases had been decided. (Two claims 
won an award total of $3.5 million, nine were dis­
missed and 14 withdrawn). 
In the summer of 1951, there occurTed a dramatic change which destroyed the predictions made forthe size of the final claims docket. It appears now that many of the Indian attorneys held off on filing to await the outcome of the early decisions. Also, many tribes had difficulty securing legal representation. And, as always in these claims, the case work-up was tedious and time consuming. The result was that in the last weeks of the 5 year filing period the activity increased tremendously. As this rush de­veloped, congressional friends ofthe Indian made an attempt to extend the filing period for 1 year but failed. The flurry of claims filing intensified in the last month and a half of the filing period, which saw double the number filed in the 4;6 years before. With all the claims in, the total came to 370 petitions that were divided eventually into more than 600 dockets. 
The Commission was confronted with a massive job. Almost all the 176 known tribes or bands filed one or more claims on old grievances. Only 17 tribes (as of July 1951) were undecided as to their desire to file claims and several said they had none. 23 The Commission had some 600 claims before it, only 26 of which had been adjudicated by the end of 1951.

Primarily these claims, most of which were con­cerned with western lands, dealt with the under­valuation of tribal lands transferred to the United States in treaties of purchase. But many concerned the alleged failure of the Government to abide by treaty provisions and called for an historical ac­counting. It was estimated that the tribes spent one million dollars preparing their early cases for trial. 24 
The Commission was a new concept for the In­dians and it embodied unprecedented causes for legal action. The immediate difficulty was to dis­tinguish the role of a commission from that of a court. It will be recalled that the earliest legislation to enact a claims forum was in the form of a court but, after 19.35 the commission framework was settled upon. In spite of this titular designation, his­tory proved stronger than semantics. Since 1881 it was the Court of Claims that had handled all Indian tribal cases and it was to this body ofprecedent that the new Commission looked. These procedures and theories were thus largely adopted by the Commis­sion, in effect making it a court, a reality formally acknowledged early in the life of the Commission.25 
The Commission evolved a workable procedure to accomplish its task. The great majority of claims, being land cases, were heard in three stages: title, value-liability, and offsets. The title phase was often a difficult one for the Commission. Establishing the "definable territory the Indians occupied exclu­sively" was a most complex undertaking and re­quired the labor of experts in the field and in the archives. If and when the first stage was decided in favor ofthe tribe, then the trial proceeded to the next stage. At least 2 years or more were required for preparation. Valuation-liability proceedings were usually lengthy and required the expert testimony of many specialists and diligent research in a mass of governmental records. Many judgments on inclusion of pertinent information distilled from this vast amount of material had to be made along the way. With the liability. of the United States Government established, the last stage, that of determination of allowable offsets, took place before a final award could be made. These stages required two inter­
locutoryjudgments and a final judgment by the Com­mission. Each stage almost always received motions for rehearing (and appeal after 1961) and, the final jUdgment was appealable to the Court of Claims and

to the Supreme Court through ~ writ of certiorari. The appeal process took from 8 months to .3 years as a matter of course. Also there were numerous miscellaneous motions for time extensions or the admission of new evidence. 
The apparent slow process of the Commission's early work and the probability of the job being a protracted one troubled Congress. Chief Commis­sioner Witt often explained that the nature of the litigation precluded quick resolutions. Justice Department representative Perry Morton concurred with Witt stating, "there is nothing as complex as these cases."26 Outside of Government, interested parties were also anxious about the Commission's progress. In late 1954, specialists with extensive experience in Indian-~Iaims work gathered at a symposium in Detroit to explore mutually the prob­lem of expert courtroom testimony and propose remedies for the difficulties that had arisen. All groups declared that they wanted quicker action. 
As mentioned above, the determination of the tribal boundaries, duration of tribal possession of the land, and the appraisal of its value called for the advice of expert witnesses. Without this material the job of the Commission would have been nearly impossible. But the massive, often technical input of the experts frequently served as much to complicate the litigatory procedure as to clarify it. Anthro­pologist Julian H. Steward of the University of Illinois noted that "virtually no evidence presented in these cases can properly be called 'primary evi­dence,' 'first hand knowledge,' or an 'eye witness account' " and "it is therefore ridiculous to pro­claim that the facts speak for themselves." The Commissioners learned this reality quite early and asked for more than the "facts" as they were. For their total consideration they asked for theories, interpretations, and the reasoned deductions that led the expert to the formulation of his final opinion. 
This type of evidence was presented and allowed because the expert witness, unlike the ordinary witness, could offer his opinion. In spite of the deficiencies of the process, attorney Donald C. Gormley, of one of the most prominent firms en­gaged in Indian law (Wilkinson, Boyden, Cragun & Barker, Law Offices, Washington, D.C.. ) felt that where expert opinion had been employed' 'there was no question but that the tasks of the Commission

In 1846 the Attorney General of the United States wrote in his repon to the President: "There is nothing in the whole compass of our laws so hard to bring within precise definition or logical or scientific arrangement as the relation in which the Indian stands to the United States," 


and the counsel had been greatly aided, and the 
cause ofjustice forwarded. "21 
Another hotly contested issue (and agent ofdelay) 
of Indian claims was that of gratuitous offsets. The 
debate over the justice of offsetting gratuities did 
not end with the passage of the Commission Act in 
1946. Though the Act eliminated for offset purposes 
about one-fourth of the more than 50 categories of 
gratuities, the remaining ones brought a debate on 
every case where claimed. To be allowable as an 
offset the item claimed must have been a gratuitous 
expenditure made without obligation on the part of 
the Government to make it or the Indians to repay it. 
It also must have been of benefit to the tribe rather 
than to an individual. Under Section 2 of the Com­
mission Act the limitations with respect to allow­
able offsets had to be observed. Lastly, the Com­
mission was to determine if the nature of the claim 
and the whole course of dealing between tribe and 
Government warranted the offset. 
The gratuities issue was made a part of the life of 
the Commission by Section 2 of the Act, which 
allowed them as offsets. The Commission, though, 
allowed relatively lower percentages of offsets 
pleaded as the years passed. In a case decided in 
1957, only $400,000 was allowed of the $2 million 
pleaded by the Government. But e'ven the $400,000 
was eliminated on rehearing.28 Certainly the allow­
ance of offsets complicated the work of all parties 
involved in the claims, but their negative impact on 
the awards probably declined. 
The debate on renewal of the life of the Commis­sion began in 1955. In that year the Senate consid­ered a bill granting a 5-year extension, but it died. In 1956 the House passed a bill simply granting 5 more years to the Commission. This was debated and amended by the Senate but finally agreed upon in conference and, in 1956, a brief law was passed that continued the. Commission for 5 more years.29 
The question and problems in law that arose in the first decade of the Commission were equal in complexity to the procedural development. For this reason their parallel elaboration deserves separate consideration.

Indians should have "their day in court." But the 
forum created for this purpose was a commission. In 
establishing a temporary Commission of three men, 
Congress exercised its political function, fashioning 
new legal "causes of action" and acknowledging 
the possible liability of the United States. But the 
Commission was a court in fact and its method was 
adjudicatory. It functioned largely as did the Court 
of Claims but dealt only with Indian claims. Its ex­
panded grounds for Government liability gave the 
Indian a wider scope of claims presentation and the 
potential for greater success in award recovery. 
The Commission Act allowed any identifiable 
group of Indian claimants residing in the United 
States or Alaska to sue the Government for 
(1) claims in law or equity arising under the Consti­tution, laws, treaties of the United States, and Executive orders of the President; (2) all other claims in law or equity, including those sounding in tort, with respect to which the claimant would have been entitled to sue in a court of the United States if the United States was subject to suit; (3) claims which would result if the treaties, contracts, and agreements between the claimant and the United States were revised on the ground of fraud, duress, unconscionable consideration, mutual or unilateral mistake, whether oflaw or fact, or any other ground cognizable by a court of equity; (4) claims arising from the taking by the United States, whether as the result of a treaty of cession or otherwise, of lands owned or occupied by the claimant without the pay­ment for such lands ofcompensation agreed to by the claimant; and (5) claims based upon fair and honor­able dealings that are not recognized by any existing rule of law or equity.30 Parts (3) and (5) created several new causes of action, allowed the Commis­sion to "go behind" or treat the Indian treaties as if revised, and gave cognizance to the broad concept 
of moral claims. The reaction to these causes of action by the claimants on the one side and the Justice Department on the other, and the theoreti­cally neutral Commission and Court of Claims in the middle, formed the legal history ofthe Indian Claims Commission. 
As a highly specialized court, the Commission had some unique characteristics. The Commission sent, as required, a written explanation of its function to all potential claimants, as garnered from the list furnished by the B.LA. (Section 13a) and followed this up (Section 17) with a notice for claims presen­tation. Ultimately it received 370 petitions (a single 
"Section 2. 60 Stal 1049 Aug. 13 1946 

tribe often having several) that were eventually 
separated into 617 dockets. It also was authorized 
(Section 13b) its own Investigation Division to check 
all claims referTed to it, but this provision was rarely 
used or deemed necessary. The Commission's prin­
cipal office was in the District of Columbia but its 
members were free to travel for field hearings, onsite 
land inspections, and conferences whenever neces­
sary. All of its final decisions were subject to appeal 
by either party and the Commission itself could ask 
the Court of Claims for guidance on questions of 
law. Appeals might result in affirmation, reversal, 
remand for future proceedings or any combination 
of the three. Its final report to Congress on a claim 
ended its duty and forever barred' 'any further claim 
or demand against the United States arising out of 
the matter involved in the controversy. "31 
The Act of 1946 laid out the general framework for 
the prosecution of the claims. The tribes could 
secure representation of their choice, SUbject to the 
approval of the Secretary ofInterior. The Attorney 
General or his assistants were to represent the 
United States Government. The Indian Tribal 
Claims Branch of the General Accounting Office 
(G.A.O.) garnered the vital fiscal information and 
data needed by both sides and presented it in a de­
tailed report to all parties (the G.S.A. handled this 
job after February 27, 1965). If a trial, with appeals, led to a final money award, the only kind allowed the Commission, it was certified and reported to Congress as with the Court of Claims. All awards were automatically referred to the Treasury and the Bureau of the Budget and included in the next appropriation bill. (Separate appropriation was made unnecessary in 1978.) Final payment to the Indians was then deposited in the Treasury until Congress directed how it should be distributed among the various members of the tribes. 
The many tribal land cessions to the United States made up the main source of alleged wrongs that the Indian claimants sought to redress. They held that the United States acquired valuable land for unconscionably low prices in bargains struck between unequals. The typical case before the Com­mission was a claim for additional compensation over the amount originally granted in the "taking" or purchase of the land. Just over 80 percent of these transactions were by treaty and involved sbme com­pensation in the form of money, goods, services or a combination of the three. Ifthe Commission recog­nized Government liability for "grossly inadequate" 
"See the Act of 1946 Section 22(b), and the' 'General Rules ot'Procedure forthe Indian Claims Commission," F<deral R<gisler, Vol. 21, No. 216, Nov 6, 1956 These 
Procedures were revised in 1968. and printed by the Commi~sion 
8 consideration, the difference between that consider­ation and the fair market value of the land at the time of the treaty was awarded. 32 
The other type ofclaim that embodied most of the remaining non-land cases was that for a Government accounting. When the Marshall Court, in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, accorded to tribes the status of domestic dependent nations it established a special relationship between the Federal Govern­ment and the Indians. The Government, as legal guardian for the tribes, became accountable for its management of tribal funds. The mismanagement, misfeasance, or mishandling of such funds consti­tuted a major source of Indian claims. Again, the General Services Administration (G.A.O. before 1965) provided the detailed accounting reports for all cases, whether to establish offsets for the land cases or to show fiscal irresponsibility in the accounting cases. In most of these cases a long and complex trial was necessary because, as historian Thomas LeDuc has pointed out, "the material facts are not only embarrassingly abundant but buried in a mass of irrelevant government records. "33 The attor·· ney's job was the disinterment of this material. 
It was only late in the second decade of the Com­mission's life that the claimants first pressed the accounting cases, the second most numerous type of claim. These cases required an accounting by the Government of any funds belonging to Indians, how they came into being, how they were expended, and what balances were held in the United States Treas­ury. Many of these records were quite old and the accounting involved thousands of transactions. The reports were made up by the G.S.A. The Govern­ment attorneys filed these reports with the Commis­sion and later answered the exceptions made by the claimants. A trial was then held to determine the degree, ifany, of fiduciary culpability on the part of the Government. 
The Government was permitted all defenses ex­cept statute of limitations or laches. The Justice Department might move for dismissal ofthe claim on summary judgment if the petition did not, in its opinion, state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Failing this, it stated its defense and moved to trial.

experts were likely to be historians and anthropolo­e 
gists. The Attorney General offered in evidence, beside the testimony of his experts, duly certified 
e 
information and papers from any department or agency of the Government. The Commission con­sidered this material in a very liberal and flexible manner. 
In the second, or valuation phase, the Govern­ment's and claimant's expert appraisers valued the land as of the treaty date, and the records were combed to determine the compensation received by the Indians as per agreement. 34 The Commission determined the fair market value, compared it with the compensation received to determine the Govern­ment's liability, and thus fixed the size of the award, if any. 

The final phase was that of offsets. These were, again, the gratuities given by the Government to the claiming tribe after the date the claim arose. The Attorney General, on receipt of the petition, re­quested an accounting by the General Services Administration. When computed, those gratuities allowed by law were deducted from the total award made in the valuation phase. 
Whenever the parties questioned the Commis­sion's conclusion regarding errors of fact or law, or where there was newly discovered evidence, a motion for rehearing might be filed. The parties could also appeal interlocutory decisions after the 1960 amendment to the Act (74 Stat. 829). Determin­ations of questions of law by the Court of Claims were reviewable by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari. 
The Indian attorney's role in these cases was that of the proponent. No member of or delegate to Congress could practice before the Commission. Upon his employment, subject to approval of the Secretary of the Interior, he filed a certified copy of his contract with the Commission. He was to work with the tribe to formulate its claim and file the claims petition with the Commission. He secured expert witnesses when necessary. The Act provided the attorneys for the Indians with complete access to all Government records. 
The case did not end for the Indian attorney on final decision. He had then to make application be­fore the Commission for fees and reimbursable ex­penses. A detailed petition was filed with the Commission and served on the Attorney General. 
UNo compilation of' the Indian attorneys' expense for experts is available and little of the Government's. The one report of the Justice Department, though. may be a fair sample .. The Department spent $2.5 million from 1954 through 1962 for its expert witnesses. $176J1OO was spent in 1961 and $411.106 in the peak year of 1960 U.S. Congress. House.

Payment from the claimant's award was usually approved, but on occasion the Commission deter­mined that a further hearing was necessary. At this hearing the attorney had to justify his fee and ex­penses in order to receive emolument, but valid challenges sometimes resulted in a reduced figure. In no case could the fee exceed 10 percent of the final award. 
The role of the Commission, as noted earlier, was much like that of a court of Indian claims. It molded its rules of procedure after a court and functioned largely as one. Technically it was a quasi-judicial branch of the legislature. In its lifetime there was little opposition to the litigatory interpretation of its function orto this rendering of the intent of Congress. This process continued for the life of the Commission. 
Within this procedural-legal context the Commis­sion refereed as the adversaries fell to battling over the interpretation of the complex issues raised by the new act. The great bulk of the early debate sur·· rounded the use of the legal defense ofresjudicata or previous decision, tribal existence as an entity capa­ble of bringing suit and the definition of "identifi­able group," the payment of interest, and, most im­portant, the establishment and compensability of Indian title. 
The first case of the Commission, that oftheWest­ern (Old Settlers) Cherokee, involved the legal prin·· ciple of res judicata. Res judicata makes a prior judgment binding in a second suit on the same cause of action between the same parties. The first judg­ment determines every issue in the second suit which was or could have been litigated in the initial suit. This principle is applied to ensure finality of judg­ment and to protect litigants from a multiplicity of suits. The Western Cherokees alleged that a mistake was made in the writing of their treaty and they claimed damages under the fair and honorable deal­ing clause. The Commission dismissed the claim on grounds of res judicata on motion by defandant. The Government had contended that the same facts and the same parties were involved in this case and a previous one in the Court of Claims (88 Ct. CI. 452, 1939). Since a large portion of the claims had been submitted to the Court of Claims prior to 1946 by earlier jurisdictional acts this precedent could have voided many of the Indian claims with the Commis­sion. The Court of Claims, however, reversed the Commis~ion. It held that the prior decision on the same sUbj~ct matter with the same parties did not bar 
the claim before the Commission because the claim was one of the new causes of action not justiciable in prior cases. That is, not only must there be the 

same facts and the same parties, but the same cause of action must be sued on for the defense of res judicata to bar the claim. Situations did occur later where res judicata was a proper defense, but only rarely, because the Commission Act had greater breadth than most of the prior special jurisdictional acts.35 
Another early decision of the Commission was that on which particular parties were allowed to bring suit. Some early pressure on behalf of indi­vidual claimants necessitated a definitive ruling and affirmation of Section 2 which states that the Com­mission shall hear and determine claims "on behalf of any tribe, band, or other identifiable group of American Indians residing within the territorial limits of the United States or Alaska." Acceptance of individual claims, it was stated numerous times, was against the intent of Congress and would have resulted in a docket too huge to manage. Thus the Commission held basically to the claims generated from the 176 groups recognized by the Indian Bureau and notified by the Commission in July 1947. But this ruling did not leave the Commission without prob­
lems with this Section. 
The expression "tribe" often has been a tricky one for the experts on Indian affairs. The term "nation" was most used in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and was a more appropriate designation than tribe because it referred more to a cultural than a political unity. Tribe came to be used generally after the Federal Government began exclu­sively handling Indian relations. Indians, said anthropologist A. L. Kroeber, were distinguished as they lived in a "tribal condition" or in a settled, ,.civilized condition." Tribes were treated as sovereign-state-tribes, for it made dealings more convenient and practical. "It was we Caucasians," said Kroeber, "who again and again rolled a number of related obscure bands or minute villages into the larger package of a 'tribe,' which we then puta­tively endowed with sovereign power and territorial 
ownership w.hich the native nationality had mostly never even c1aimed."36 
The claims were generally presented in the con­text of this tribal presupposition and were thus potentially as faulty as the notion of the tribe.37 In cases where tribes appeared not to have existed or failed to fit the white's political construct, they

could be excluded from suit and thus penalized when, in fact, their land use and possession was a reality. Under these circumstances Congress recog­nized the category of "other identifiable group" in 1946 to include all groups that might suffer exclusion by semantics.38 
The most difficult factual problem facing the Com­mission was the question of what definable territory the Indians occupied exclusively. The Act allowed claims (Section 2 (4» arising from the "taking" of lands "owned or occupied" by claimants without proper compensation. The Commission, following the Supreme Court ruling in U.S. v. Santa Fe Pacific 
R.R. Co. (1941), held that e.xclusive occupancy had to be shown in a definable territory to establish aboriginal possession. Only when Indian title rested on exclusive tribal use and occupation from "time immemorial" was there a compensable interest. The Indians, thus, had a vested interest in the concept of tribe in the twentieth century as the whites did in the nineteenth and were obliged to prove its exist­
39
ence.Herein rested the role ofthe anthropologist. 
The job of the expert, at this point in a land case, was critical for the claimant. The Court of Claims held that use and occupancy were to be inferred from all the facts and circumstances in each case. If the Government demonstrated that more than one tribe used a particular area, exclusivity was denied and recovery on that area was usually disallowed. The claimant's task to demonstrate this exclusivity was most difficult. Occupancy itself was an arduous matter to prove conclusively. As it pertained to Indian title, exclusivity referred to land-resource use. Most Indians were organized in small, local­ized, autonomous units ranging in size from the single family to multi-family groups and each unit 
habitually exploited specific areas in their food quest. Rarely did a group's numbers exceed 500, with only a few reaching 2,000 or more. To qualify for occupancy, land use must have been consistent, either continual or seasonal, and the use must have been of vital importance in the economy of the people constituting the group.40 
The qualifying term, "exclusive," added immea­surably to the problems presented above. Not think­ing of land per se in terms of ownership but

of the resources on it, tribes claimed use of the land 
but allowed others access also. Exclusivity was ex­
clusively a white man's concept. But occupation and 
exclusivity were yet further complicated by the 
second qualifying term of "time immemorial." 
Selectively, this term had some meaning, but for 
many Indian groups it could not be applied. Many in 
situ by 1700 were not there in 1600 and others in situ 
by 1800 were not there in 1700.41 Obviously the 
Commission, even with the aid of the experts, could 
not secure definitive "facts" on these issues and 
had great latitude for seasoned judgment. Each case, 
usually ladened with an enormous mass of data, had 
to a degree to be considered separately. No doubt a 
trio of Solomons would have been hard put to render 
judgments satisfactory to all in these cases. Of 
course, if it was shown that the Government had 
recognized the rights of a tribe to a specific tract, 
then it was unnecessary for the tribe to prove its 
actual use and occupancy of that area. 
The recognition by the Government of Indian rights in the land, or "recognized title," presented the Commission, as it did the Court of Claims before it, with a major battle in claims litigation. It was Indian title that was established when continuous, exclusive occupation was demonstrated. This in jurisprudence was a question of fact. Recognized title was always a result of Congressional action, a question of law. This took the form of a treaty or Congressional agreement which specifically granted to a tribe permanent legal rights of occupancy in a sufficiently defined area. 
Generally, before the Act, only a claim based on recognized title could receive compensation. Out of the 370 petitions filed pursuant to the Act, most in­volved Indian title with no ratified treaty of recogni­tion. 42 In the Alcea case the Supreme Court appar­ently had decided that the taking of land held under Indian title was compensable under the Fifth Amendment. But in a subsequent per curiam deci­sion in the same case, the Court held that its earlier decision had rested on a statutory direction to pay and not on any obligation under the Constitution. Thus, it was still held that compensation in these cases was a political matter for Congress, not a legal one for the courts. In Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. U.S., the Supreme Court ruled that their land was held merely by the grace of the sovereign, so that what­ever interest they had in it could be terminated with­out obligation to compensate under the Fifth

Amendment. Only recognized title called for such compensation on taking, and the Tee-Hit-Ton had no such recognition. But the Court indicated that this decision might not affect the claims before the Com­mission. The Court of Claims, in the same year as the Tee-Hit-Ton case (1955), upheld a Commission decision that Indian title was compensable under Section 2 of the Commission Act. This was the land­mark Otoe and Missouria case. 43 
The case of Otoe and Missouria Tribe ofIndians 
v. U.S. was a leading one in Indian claims and a critical precedent for the Commission. In the Otoe case the Commission ruled that its Act provided a remedy for seizure of lands held under Indian title. It was a momentous trial involving hundreds of docu­ments and exhibits and 1,500 pages of testimony in hearings. And, it was a signal victory for the claimants. 
Another key issue of precedent for the Commis­sion was that of interest on the awards. In one of the Commission's earliest decisions, the Loyal Creek case, it ruled, and was affirmed by the Court of Claims, that interest not be allowed on the award. The Commission and the Court were guided not so much by the Creek's case as by the firm rulings of previous Supreme Court decisions. Soon after, in the Osage Nation case, the Commission confirmed and broadened the denial of interest in the Creek case under its provision for "fair and honorable deal­ings." Interest was also denied in the Osage case which was tried under the provision for "uncons­cionable consideration." Relying on the Creek case, the Court of Claims affirmed the Commission and held that no "taking" of the Osage's property oc­curred in the constitutional sense and hence no interest was allowable. 44 
Behind the precedent, and the most compelling reason for it, as seen in the Alcea case, was what has been called "judicial fiscal responsibility." In­terest is due only in cases of a Fifth Amendment "taking," a very small portion of the claims. If allowed under other forms of taking, interest alone could have mounted into billions of dollars. This at least was the argument used by the Solicitor General to the Supreme Court in the Alcea appeal. The award of $15 million in interest on a $3 million settlement seemed to bear him out and the Court reversed it­self. 45 Justice Department officials agreed with this

"financially judicious" stand and thus the Commis­sion and the Court of Claims adhered to the earlier Supreme Court ruling that "Congress, not this Court or other federal courts, is the custodian of the national purse. "46 
The Commission, as might be expected of any such adjudicatory body that was engaged in resolv­ing ancient and fiercely partisan issues, faced many challenges. Chief Commissioner Witt often tried to convey the complexity of his office. Speaking to the House Appropriations Committee toward the end of the Commission's first decade, he attempted to pin­point the higher purpose of his agency. "We have tried to keep in mind the interests of the taxpayers but also what is right for the Indians," and "above all be fair. " The Indians may have been conquerors themselves but it was a fact 
that the Christian spirit and the human spirit actuate our type of people, requiring us to do justice towards these people, and not just undertake to say that 'to the victor belongs the spoils,' and 'get hither' to the vanquished; that we owed them a moral duty of some compensation for tak­ing away from them the lands where we found them, fr'om which they were then making their livelihood.47 
The Court of Claims also saw the Commission as a positive agent of good. In the Otae and Missal/ria opinion the Court wrote of the Commission Act: 
The Indian Claims Commission Act is both remedial legisla­tion and special legislation It broadens the Government's consent to suit and as such is in derogation of its sovereign­ty. It confers special privileges upon the Indian claimant apart from the rest of the community, and to some extent is in derogation of the common law. This was, we think, be­cause of the peculiar nature of the dealings between the Government and Indians from very early times. On the other hand, it remedies defects in the common law and in pre-existing statutory law as those laws affected Indians, and it was designed to correct certain evils of long standing and well known to Congress. Fortunately, under these cir­cumstances, rules of interpretation and construction are subordinate to the principle that the object of all construc­tion and interpretation is the just and reasonable operation of the particular statute, and accordingly it should be possi­ble to construe the statute liberally to affect its remedial 
purpose and intent, and strictly to limit undue abrogation of fundamental rights or to prevent undue extension of extraordinary remedies .48 
The Commission, the courts, the attorneys, and all ~heothers involved in these claims did their duty as they saw it from 1947 to 1957. The Commission assembled a formidable docket soon after it was

constituted. Under its rules of procedure the advo·· cates of both sides vigorously attacked the moun­tainous legal and material problems presented by the 151 year claim backlog. The Court of Claims strove to add its wisdom, experience, and guidance to this difficult process. The Commission faced and re­solved many issues and saw new ones created in this first decade. Precedent directed much of its action, but a growing experience with the claims, more familiarity with the Act's provisions and prece­dential rulings on them, and the expanding life of the Commission brought some changes in the positions of all parties involved. First of all, of course, the life ofthe Commission, made unrealistically short by the Act of 1946, had to be extended. 
The Second Decade; Renewal and Reform, 
1957-1967 
The enabling act of the Commission granted it a 10-year life span and did not provide for extension on the contingency that it might not complete its work. This specific limitation was unavoidable at the time to gain enactment. The Act also complied with the legal principle that restricted a too-liberal grant of power and life to "quasi-judicial" agencies. Therefore Congress extended the life of the Commis­sion in 1956, and again in 1961,1967, 1972, and 1976 because the job was still unfinished. The extension act of 1967 increased the number of Commissioners from three to five, and firmed up the procedures. The fact was that the time span of 20 years (or even 32 as it developed) was not an exorbitant one to re­solve the immense and complex backlog of work involved in over 600 claims covering 150 years. The 
case exhumation and presentation, and the defense in the courtroom context was inherently a lengthy procedure. The Commission could and did tighten its own procedures where lax; but it had to function within the limits set by Congress in its Act, the precedents prescribed by its adversary forum, and the always difficult legal issues of Indian law. 
Through the late 1950's and into the 1960's the Commission persisted in its work. Its staffnumbered 14 and operated on a budget of $132,000 by 1957. 49 In its first decade the Commission had completed 80 cases and awarded $17.1 million on the 15 claims held to be valid. By the end of 1959, the Commission had dismissed 30 more claims, accorded some atten­tion to over half of the remaining dockets, had a

stable budget for 2 years in a row, and declared that the staff was adequate. 
From mid-1959 into 1961 the work of the Commis­sion slowed due to personnel changes. In the summer of 1959 Commissioner Louis J. O'Marr resigned and Senator Arthur V. Watkins was ap­pointed to replace him. The following year Chief Commissioner Witt resigned, and T. Harold Scott, an attorney from Boulder, Colorado, who had worked for the Federal Trade Commission, took his seat on the Commission. Watkins then was ap­pointed Chief Commissioner. Watkins had been elected to the Senate from Utah in 1946 and 1952and was a member of the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs for that period, being its chairman during his last 4 years in office. 
This "period of transition," as Watkins later re­ferred to it, during which the two new Commis­sioners acclimated themselves, seemed to slow the progress of claims disposition. 50 The increase of work from that of the early and mid-1950's to the completion of 14 dockets per year from 19.57 through 1959, with a peak of 20 in 1960, fell off to 10 in 1961 and only six in 1962. It did not surpass 20 again until 1965.51 But this transition effected a striking change in the management and production of the Com­mission. 
After 1960 the Commission lost little time in initiating changes necessary to increase its output. The Commissioners knew well the feelings of Congress toward their Commission, and its concern about the seemingly slow progress.52 Chief Com­missioner Watkins had observed when first ap­pointed that the Government and Indian lawyers set the hearings by mutual agreement and then notified the Commission. He felt that this leisurely proce­dure was untenable and planned a regular calendar controlled by the Commission. In September 1960 the Commission called the first calendar conference. The participants were told that "justice delayed is oftenjustice denied" and informed that, to end much of the delay, a continuous 3-·year schedule of hear­ings would be followed. By this calendar, the Com­mission would hear an average of 30 claims per year and limit continuances to extreme emergencies. In 
addition to tightening the trial schedule, the Com­mission urged all parties to try to reach compromise

settlements. The Commission initiated a procedure 
to better inform the Indians of the proposed settle­
ment and to insure their understanding and approval. 
Previously the Commission had no way of knowing 
to what extent the tribes were involved in the com­
promise settlements. The Commission firmly estab­
lished the "Omaha Rule" to obviate future recrimin­
ations in cases of compromise settlement.53 
The Commission entered the final year of its sec­
ond 5-year extension with a staff, in 1961, 17 strong 
and with a budget ofover $205,000. As of 1960, some 
125 cases had been disposed of and $42 million 
awarded. This represented a small fraction of the 
billions in payment forseen by some" These low 
annual award totals began to rise rapidly, though, 
after 1960. The cumulative total to 1959 of $20 mil­
lion more than doubled in 1960 and this figure quin­
tupled by 1966. Nineteen sixty-one was a low point 
in case-disposal over the previous 5 years but the 
award total was five times that of 19.59. The new trial 
calendar was rigorously enforced. Of the 104 cases 
set for 1960,86 were heard and only 18 received con­
tinuances for good cause.54 Five cases, already 
processed by 1960, matured to awards totaling $15 
million. But the Commission still had the bulk of its 
work ahead of it: 471 of the .596 dockets still re­
mained. An Administration bill calling for another 
extension was submitted to Congress in 1961. 
Congressional consideration of the bill of exten­sion for the Commission mostly took place in May 1961. It was a short, unheated debate and it appeared that 14 years of operation had established the Com­mission's legitimacy, at least among most of the members of the Indian committees. All the parties involved concurred that the original time period was too short for the unexpected work load the Com­mission received and they agreed that another exten­sion was necessary to give the claimants their "day in court. "55 The bills submitted to the Indian com· mittees requested a 5-year extension, expansion of the Claims Commission membership from three to five, and the authorization of the use of hearing examiners to accelerate the work.56 The consensus

that emerged was that the growing experience of the Commission, its better accomodations, and the new trial calendar offered real hope for completion by 1967. The problem ofgiving the Indian his due had to be balanced somehow with giving him his walking papers, that is, ending government supervision" And, what was accomplished had to be done with finality, for the spector of the old jurisdictional acts haunted the Commission's work as it had all earlier efforts at claims settlement. A Senate Committee report echoed two generations of claims rhetoric when it recognized these facts and concluded: 
It cannot be stressed too strongly that the Claims Commis­sion Act was passed by Congress to give the Indians their day in court to present their claims of every kind. shape and variety.. Until all these claims are heard and settled, we may expect the Indians to resist any effort to terminate federal supervision and control over them 57 
The Commission extension act of June 1961, like that of 1956 simply provided a five-year extension of the Commission.58 The other suggested amend­ments could not be agreed upon and were dropped. It was in 1967 that Congress would radically alter and try more vigorously to force the Commission to real­ize its goal of extinguishing itself and its claims docket. Before that, the Commission disposed of 106 more cases and awarded another $170 million. 
The early 1960's also saw another key change in theclaimsprocedure, that oftheestablishment ofthe Revolving Fund for expert assistance loans. This Fund was necessitated by the rulings in the Crow and Northern Paiute cases of 1961. 59 Prior to these cases expert witnesses were sometimes employed by the Indians on a contingent fee basis. The practice had been allowed as in other courts, but some feared that the testimony might be weighted in the light of the financial interest of the witness in the outcome of the case. Even when the attorneys themselves paid the experts, the fact of the lawyer's own contingent contract disturbed some observers. The Commis­sion recommended that Congress make funds avail­able for this expense, which many an impecunious tribe could not bear. 60 A bill introduced by Repre­sentative James A. Haley of Florida became law in late 1963. This new law, not funded until July 1964, 
provided for a $900,000 fund for interest-bearing loans to be made available to only those tribes with·­

out other funds to employ expert witnesses. Repay­ tt  
ment was to be out of awards or to be declared non­ o  
repayable at the discretion of the Secretary of In­ 
terior in cases of dismissal. This fund was fully sub­ a

applications pending. With some 30 tribes having  a  
sought loans, Congress doubled the fund total in 1966.61  n ti  
The second decade of the Commission was a busy  h  
time. The number of case-disposals, after the  o  
"transition period" and a low point of 1962, was  d  
almost tripled in 1963. The number of major inter­ r  
locutory decisions doubled in the same period. 62  !!  
These figures are meant only to relate to the Com­ t  
mission's overall progress toward extinguishing its  (  
total docket and not as an accurate measure, by com­ (  
parison, of yearly progress. The 3-year period from  t  
1964 to 1966 saw more awards (48) than in the 17  t  
years previous (45). The $111 million paid out in  
those 3 years was also greater than the total to 1963.  
At the same time, the number of dismissals was  
lower than any previous 3-year period.63 In 1966 the  
Commission had heard every case the Indians had  
readied and said it had the capacity for up to 50 more  
if the attorneys were prepared.  
With the need for an extension agreed upon by all  
parties, the debate focused on three issues: the  
length ofthe extension period, the rigidity ofthe new  
trial calendar, and the expansion of the Commission  
membership.64 The debate of 1967 occassioned a  
thorough revival of all the fundamental issues of the  
Commission's creation and an opportunity to ac­ 
quaint many in public and private life with its very  
existence.  
The first issue, that of time, was easily resolved.  
The idea of only a 2-year extension was first con­ 
sidered merely as an emergency measure and re­ 
jected in the light ofthe amount ofwork that remained  
to the Commission. Also, the threat of so short a  
tenure, a Commission report warned, would cause  
an "immediate exodus ofour ablest stafflawyers."65  
Another 5-year extension period was a foregone con­ 
clusion but both Watkins and the Indian Law Com­ 
mittee ofthe Federal Bar Association felt that a 7-year period would be more realistic. 66 By 1967; though;

the 5 year figure had become institutionalized. The other two issues were not so easily disposed of. 
Congress thought that the statutory imposition of a firm trial calendar was the most expeditious way to hasten the claims cases to final resolution. A House and a Senate bill called for a 5-year extension and a new section (27) establishing this calendar. This sec­tion provided for a trial date for all pending claims no later than January 1, 1970. Ifa claimant was "unable or unwilling" to proceed, the Commission was to dismiss with prejudice and thus preclude reinstate­ment. It provided for one 6·month extension for good cause and a stay on this if a compromise was in the process of negotiation. By these measures the Congress expressed its intent to end the life of the Commission in 1972 and to require assurances from the Commission that all claims would be disposed by that date. 
The last issue was that of increasing the number of Commissioners, which was yet another attempt to hasten the end. The lawmakers hoped that an in­crease in personnel, along with the change in the Act, would bring progress. It was reasoned that more Commissioners and a larger staff would result in more work being done. 
The bill that finally became law on April 10, 1967, was a compromise agreement. 67 It renewed the Commission for 5 more years and expanded it to five members; the President would designate a "chair­man." The seated Commissioners were to continue in office only until June 30, 1968, unless reappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate prior to that date. The new law established a firm trial calendar and targeted, with exceptions, 1970 as the final year for the trial of all pending claims. 
In the period under discussion two main legal problems beset the Commission, and both affected its effort to expedite the workload. One was the con­fusion over Clause .3 of Section 2 of the Act. This clause, among other things, allowed claims that would result if dealings between the Indians and the United States were revised on the ground of "un­conscionable consideration." In one of the Sioux cases, decided in 1956 (146 Fed. Supp. 229), the Court of Claims ruled that unconscionable consider­ation was that which was "so much less than the actual value of the property sold that the disparity shocks the conscience." The Court acknowledged that no exact formula existed to measure the dispar­ity between payment and value and used "very gross" as its guide until 1961. 
"81 Stat 11 April 10 1%7 
The "very gross" cases were easy for the Com­
mission to handle, but when payment approached 50 
percent of the value more precision was required. In 
the Miami Tribe case the Court concurred with the 
Commission that payment of less than half the true 
value was unconscionable. Then the problems be­
gan. When the Commission denied liability of the 
Government, that is when the compensation was 
more than half the true value, the Court consistently 
reversed it by finding a smaller figure for the pay~ 
ment or a larger value for the land or claimed the 
value figure ruled on by the Commission to be a bare 
minimum. 
A missing element that slowed the work of the Commission was the lack of compromise settlements that normally dispose of most private litigation. The original Act allowed for the non..litigatory settlement of claims by the parties with the approval of the Commission. The claimants had long been allowed this right under the jurisdictional acts with approval of the Secretary of Interior. In the political arena, the Republican platform of 1956 had urged "the prompt adjudication or settlement of pending Indian claims," and the Indian claims plank of the Demo­cratic platform of 1960 insisted that the claims be "settled promptly whether by negotiation or other means, in the best interests of both parties."68 But the Commission was given no opportunity to ap­prove a compromise settlement until the claims attorneys advanced their strongest cases first and pushed for the maximum award. Also, it was long­standing policy of the Justice Department not to make settlement offers but to await them. 
It was only in 1960 that the Justice Department inaugurated a policy of encouraging settlement. One-halfthe cases which resulted in an award in 1960 were disposed by compromise settlement and 32 of the 51 from 1961 to 196.5. Watkins was encouraged by the efficacy of this procedure.69 He related that government and Indian attorneys advised him that possibly over half of the remaining cases would be settled, and he saw a chance of ending the Commis­sion's work "within a reasonable length oftime."70 Out of the 94 final awards by 1966 for a total of $194 million, settlement was negotiated in 38 for $87 million. Thirty other compromise settlements had been reached on secondary considerations such as offsets. 71 But, though settlements affected some

savings in time and expenses, the benefits, as later became apparent, proved to be limited because most settlements were reached only after substantial ad­judicative work had already been done. i2 
The placing of blame for delay in these cases was as complex as everything else connected with them. Watkins defended his and the Commission's record as laudable and refused to be singled out for censure. Justice, possibly beleagured with its 17 lawyers and 12 clerks arTayed against the formidable legal force of the claimants, also defended its past. And, the Indians' attorneys were proud of their defense of the hapless tribes against a powerful Government. But, it can be safely asserted that most of the delay was caused by other factors such as the original enor­mous workload, the lack of sufficient personnel, the use of the adversary conception of the Commission, the mass of data involved and generated, the appel­late processes, and the complex interaction of all these elements. 
Using the word in its broadest sense, the "trials" oflndian claims settlement were many. It had com­pleted only ]2 percent of its caseload by ]9.57. By 1960 some 490 cases still remained on the docket. But, after 1960, the reform program dramatically boosted the performance of the Commission, doub­ling its annual output. The award total in 1960 stood at $42 million and at $226 million in ]967. The Com­mission could not, though, speed its work to allow it to complete its task by ]967 and the dissatisfac­tion of the Congress grew concomitantly with the length of the life of the Commission. All the parties to the Commission's creation and function contri­buted to its seemingly slow progress, but the prime agents of delay were the wording of the Act of 1946 and the nature of the cases themselves. 
Expansion, Reorganization, and Final Renewal, 1967-1978 
With the renewal act of 1967, Congress forcibly declared its intent to finalize the Indian claims and end the Commission. To accomplish this goal it ex­panded the Commission, guaranteed it a fresh change of personnel, and more rigidly directed its work schedule. Nevertheless new problems arose to complicate the Commission's docket and frustrate all the parties involved. However, the Commission did indeed perform in an impressive fashion, ac­complishing in .5 years 63 percent of the work total compiled in its 20 years of life. Congress was so 
12Annual Report of the Indian Claims Commission. 1973. 2 
]6 
struck that in 1972 it agreed that another renewal was a necessity but decreed it to be the last and further tightened the procedural strictures. The Commis­sion, though, did not complete its task, but left a still active docket as a legacy to the courts. 
The enlargement of the Commission, and its turn­over of membership, dominated its activities for over 2 years after the renewal of April ]967. Chief Commissioner Watkins retired in October 1967, 9 months before the date set for new appointments or reappointment. This left Commissioners William Holt and T. Harold Scott without a Chairman and the Commission without the necessary three members for a quorum. Reorganization, it began to appear, took time as well as legislation. Three new Commis·· sioners were appointed in December 1967, and the year ]968 opened with the full complement of five Commissioners as required by the extension act of 1967. The President designated no chairman until March. One year of the third 5-year renewal thus 
passed in expansion and reorganization, that is, one­fifth of the period that Congress granted to the Com­mission to wind up its work. About 40 percent ofthe task was completed in the previous 20 years: the remaining 60 percent was targeted for extinction in the next five. By early 1968 the chances for this seemed as remote as they were in the 1946 projec­tion. 
Nevertheless, the congressional mandate for "new blood" had been fulfilled-three-fifths of the expanded Commission was freshly appointed by 1968. These positions were filed by John T. Vance, Richard W. Yarborough, and Jerome K. Kuykendall. Vance had been an attorney in Montana and was on the faculty of the law school at the University of North Dakota when appointed to the Commission. Yarborough had practiced law in Texas before be­coming a legislative assistant to his father, Senator Ralph W. Yarborough, in 1958. Kuykendall was an attorney from Washington State. There he practiced law and served in the State Goverment. From 19.53 to 1961 he served as Chairman of the Federal Power Commission but returned to private practice in Washington, D.C. until appointed to the Commis­sion. i3 It was January 1968 before the Commission began operating with its full complement and, in March, Commissioner Vance was appointed Chair·· man. Three months hence, the unrenewed terms of 
Commissioners Holt and Scott expired leaving the three newcomers with a bare quorum.

It was almost a year before the Commission re­
turned permanently to full strength. Margaret Pierce 
became a fourth Commissioner in October 1968. 
Pierce spent most ofher legal career with the Federal 
Government and was the Law Clerk and Court Re­
porter of Decisions for the Court of Claims from 
1948 until her Commission appointment. A five and 
one-half month "recess'appointment" was given to 
ex-Governor of Maryland Theodore R. McKeldin in 
November 1968. Then, in May 1969, the President 
appointed Brantley Blue the fifth permanent Com­
mission member. Blue had practiced law in Kings­
port, Tennessee, and had been a city judge there 
before his appointment. He was, having Lumbee 
ancestors, the first Indian member of the Commis­
sion.74 Jerome Kuykendall, a Republican, was soon 
after, in June 1969, appointed Chairman in place of 
Democrat John Vance by the new administration. 
This last alteration rounded out the Commission's 
composition, which remained in effect until the de­
mise of the Commission on September 30, 1978. 
The new Commissioners were strongly encour­aged by Congress to complete their work. The Chair­man ofthe Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, anxious that the nominees get the "mood" ofCongress, told them that the "job must be finished by 1972 or there is going to be trouble.. " He offered the aid of his committee to help in any way possible but warned that no further extensions would be con­sidered. 
The "new Commission," in the midst ofthe sweep·· ing personnel changes, reorganized some aspects of its procedure and got "the backlog moved along." It removed, for the fourth time, to larger quarters to accommodate its expanded staff. Five more attor­neys were approved, and with the two new Com­missioners the budget of $394,000 for 1967 grew to a half a million in 1968 (90 percent of the budget was expended for salary and personnel benefits required by law). This reorganization caused some lag in work according to Commissioner Scott's testimony in early 1968,75 and case disposal had dropped from an all time annual high of 34 in 1965 to 14 in 1966 and only 9 in 1967. Nevertheless, the preparatory work was still being vigorously prosecuted by the new team and, in 1968, 26 dockets were completed.76

1~Annu111 Report of the Indian Claims Commission. 19":' '* 
The new procedures adopted by the Commission were largely responsible for its increased output. The Commission completed the trial calendar called for in the extension act of 1967 in early 1968. It then established the Office of Chief Counsel to supervise and correlate the work of the increasing staff of attorneys. On July 1.5, 1968, the amended General Rules of Procedure became effective. The Commis­sioners were aided in this revision of the procedures by an ad hoc committee of the plaintiffs and the Justice Department attorneys who practiced before the Commission. The new rules clamped down on extensions and made several minor changes for effi­ciency. It also made three important major changes. Prior to 1968, more than one Commissioner was gen­erally present at a trial. Under the new rules only one was required in attendance, which allowed his colleagues to attend to other duties or hear other cases. Another major change was the increased use 
of pretrial conferences and procedures to shorten the actual trial. Lastly, expert witnesses were re­quired to submit written testimony in advance. At the trial they testified only on cross-examination. 77 This had long been the general practice of other Federal Commissions and did more than any other change to increase the output of the Commission. 
Under its new Chairman, Jerome Kuykendall, the Commission moved ahead with its still formidable workload. By July 1, 1969, the Commission had finished 51 percent of its work. In that year the five Commissioners had 11 attorneys on the professional staffand a budget of $619,000. The work output con­tinued to rise from 1968 and the completed dockets for 1969 reached a new single-year high of 49. The next year the awards total finally surpassed that of dismissals, 163 to 159. By 1971, the Commission had doubled its legal staffto continue its increasing work output.78 
In 1970, the Commission continued the reorgani­zation of procedure. The Commission conducted a study ofits accomplishments and future work needs. This had never been done before in an analytical manner. Kuykendall testified that the Commission, as well as the Congress, never before accurately knew the extent of its workload. This analysis was completed and made available to Congress and the Bureau of the Budget. Most important, in 1970, Chairman Kuykendall told a Senate hearing that the

Commission could not finish by 1972. But he tenta­tively told them that with the 1971 budget allowance for 21 lawyers and a firm adherence to the proposed schedule. they could finish by 1976. Five more years were necessary. 79 
The Commission now moved to request a fourth renewal. It had completed 44 more dockets since 1969 and had adjusted its progress "at a rate con­sistent with completion" by April 1977. 80 Kuykendall told the House Indian Subcommittee that the "new Commission" had attempted a crash program in 1968 to finish by 1972, but staff shortages and un­accountable delays made it impossible. But, said the Chairman, since 1970 productivity was high and the prospect ofcompletion by 1977 was very good.81 He cautioned that non-renewal would mean that "those tribes who had cases not yet completed would get nothing on those claims;" about 50 tribes would not get their day in court. 82 
As the Commission entered 1972, its last year of operation by the renewal act of 1967, the movement for another extension gained momentum. The record stood at 164 dismissals and 182 awards for $410 million; 264 cases were still pending.. The Commis­sion had 42 employees and a budget of $1,04.5,000 for 1972. Chairman Kuykendall told the Senate Appropriations Committee that he "hoped" they could finish in another .5 years. 83 What had pre­viously been a hope was finally a possibility. The Commission's pace had indeed picked up. More dockets were completed by monetary awards from 1968 to 1972 than were made during the entire prior life of the Commission (102·100). (The number of dismissals also favored the claimants: 44 to 131.) 
The debate over the fourth renewal of the Com­mission was short. The bills ofrenewal made it clear that the life of the Commission was to finally end in 1977. Two similar bills Were introduced in Congress, varying only in minor points. The House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs considered allowing the Commission to end in 1972 and transferring all caseS to the Court of Claims, but it concluded that such action would result in delay and not save any administrative expenses. It was willing to extend because the renewal bill provided for (1) automatic

This bill was an administration measure worked out by the Commission and the Office of Management and Budget. With a few minor amendments to enforce calendar compliance it was accepted. Congressional intent was pointedly expressed that this renewal would be the last. "If delay on the part of the Gov­ernment threatens to defeat this policy, the Commit­tee on Interior and Insular Affairs expects to be noti­
fied at the earliest opportunity." Congress intended to tighten further its scrutiny over the Commission's work. 84 
One source of delay that threatened to slow the Commission's progress more than any other was the accounting cases. These claims, briefly discussed previously, involved some 50 cases that hinged on a Government accounting of the USe of Indian trust funds. The record of these funds usually covered many decades and involved thousands of financial transactions. The Justice Department had, as a matter of form to determine offsets, requested ac­counting reports on all petitions since 1946. This work was completed by September 1971. 85 When the numerous figures Were totaled and arrayed in appro­priate accounting form, the legal question then be­came whether the various summary expenditures charged against the Indians Were proper. For exam­ple, did the Government follow the Menominee rule and expend money from noninterest-bearing funds before interest-bearing funds? The amount to make these funds "whole" for funds judged improperly 
spent was the basis for a money judgment. But these claims had to await the Government's completion of the reports and Were pushed by plaintiffs to the end of the docket behind the more familiar land claims and were neglected until the 1960's. 
As it stood in 1971, the accountings being com­pleted, the Commission could have dealt with them despite their complexities. But in 1966, a ruling in the Southern Ute case expanded the scope of these claims. Until this decision the accountings Were re­quired only to 1946 in compliance with the Commis­sion's Act that forbade consideration of any claim accruing after August 13, 1946. Nevertheless, the

s Government had brought its reports up to 1951 be­cause most of the records were located in Washing­ton, D.C., and were completed from 1975 to 19.51. The Southern Ute decision, affirmed by the Court of Claims, held that the tribe's accounting must be up­dated from 1951 to be cun'ent with the date of trial because of the possible "continuing" nature of some of the claims. 86 
This ruling presented a potentially "insurmount­able burden" to the General Services Administra­tion. 81 The records subsequent to 1951 were mostly in federal record centers in the Mid and Far West and in field offices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Also, the number of specialized personnel in the General Services Administration needed to handle this burden was "woefully inadequate."88 When the General Services Administration received this job from the General Accounting Office in 196.5 the work had been ongoing for 40 years but was scheduled to end in 6. The General Services Administration met this schedule and finished the 96 remaining petitions plus the 19 added after 1965. It did this with its own personnel and the 37 experts that transferred from the General Accounting Office. On schedule and with a declining workload on a terminal job, the General Services Administration allowed attrition to reduce its staff. Representatives of the General Services Administration did say, though, that they could do the job if funded. Both the Justice Department and 
the Commission agreed that the Court of Claims could "readily handle" these cases if any remained after 1977. 89 Thus assured, Congress passed the fourth renewal act on March 17, 1972. 90 
The accounting issue was the main one in the de­bate over the fourth extension act but as an element of delay it was only one factor among many in the long history of items blamed for slowing the Com­mission's work and prolonging its life. Key legal decisions also contributed to the need for extension past 1972. In select claims the Commission found it necessary, "in good conscience," to set new prece­dents that led to extended litigation. 
The Commission had led a busy existence in its fourth period of renewal. Its Commissioners had changed, and many ofits procedures. Its output over 5 years improved over that of the 8-year period from 1960 to 1969: 146 to 126 dispositions. But with 227 pending cases,the Commission still had an arduous

"See note 78. 54 USee note 84 "Ibid "86 Stat, 114 March 30, 1972 
charge. To finish its total docket by 1977 it had to 
increase its annual decisions by 50 percent. This was 
a possibility but the accounting cases made it un­
likely. 
Entering its last renewal period in 1972, the Com­
mission in its remaining years set itself to finish as 
much ofits docket as possible. It also pushed for new 
administrative measures it deemed necessary to 
hasten or facilitate its work. The Commission had 
the resources to finish the bulk of its cases, that is 
the land claims, by 1977, but there were still ele­
ments of the claims process that were largely be­
yond its control. Appeals to the Court of Claims 
were the right of the two contending parties and once 
a case was taken to the Court the Commission had to 
await its ruling. Appeals were always a part of the 
Commission's litigation delay but their incidence in­
creased slightly after 1972, amounting to one-third 
ofthe cases. Several ofthe accounting cases were on 
appeal by 1975 and promised to be a form of claim 
that would necessitate appeal in every case to the 
Court of Claims and even to the Supreme Court, 
which had only granted a review on certiorari thrice 
in the life of the Commission. In total, there had 
been 206 appeals. The Commission was affirmed in 
96 of those, reversed in 79, and partially affirmed 
and reversed in the remainder. 91 Also, with the ac­
counting cases, as with appeals, the Commission had 
to wait on the work of another agency---the General 
Services Administration. 
Yet, by 1973, a good deal of activity was taking place upon the Indian claims. The Commissioners testified that they had adequate staff and budget in 1972 and 1973. Congress had moved to eliminate some areas of claims delay. The Expert Assistance Loan Fund established in 1963 and doubled in 1966 was increased again in 1973 to $2.7 million. 92 Funds were appropriated for the General Services Admin­istration in late 1972 to rebuild its accounting staff from a low point of two. This staff had reached only nine by early 1973, but in another 2 years soared to 
103.93 And, Congress streamlined the process of final award distribution. 
The Commission's progress through 1975 was good. At the close of 1972, 227 of the 611 dockets were still pending but all of the land cases were in some advanced stage of litigation or on appeaL Early in 1973, the Commission worked out a pr~jection of

annual output to complete it cases by 1977. From 
1973 through 1977 it proposed annually to complete 
33,43,79,47, and 25 cases respectively.94 Through 
1974 it was ahead ofits schedule but appeals held up 
its progress. By March 1975, 176 dockets were still 
pending. The 44 member staff, now operating on a 
budget of $1,324,000, was deemed adequate by 
Chairman Kuykendall to handle the work brought to 
it, but he could not assure the Congress that the 
work would be completed by 1977. He did say, 
though, that it was not the Commission's intention to 
ask for another extension. 95 
Other agencies of Government and the private 
sector, though, were active in promoting extension 
past 1977. At the Commission's 1976 authorization 
hearing, representatives of the Court of Claims and 
the tribes urged another renewal of at least 3 years. 
The proponents of more time believed that the re­
maining cases could best be completed in the Com­
mission rather than the Court of Claims. They saw a 
transfer of unfinished cases to the Court as ineffi­
cient, costly, and counterproductive to all con­
cerned. 96 
Several arguments to give the Commission an­other lease on life were put forward. The dissolution of the Commission as scheduled, it was claimed, would (1) leave some 120 dockets as a legacy to the Court of Claims, an unmanageable number not con­templated in 1972, (2) saddle the Court with the 51 complex accounting cases, (3) congest an already busy Court, (4) lead to further delay by the very process of transfer, (5) fail to utilize the expertise built up by the Commission, and (6) cause an in­justice to the tribes that would not be heard by the same tribunal. 
The debate over a renewal of the Commission lasted for 18 months. With little chance of gaining another 5 years, considering the directives of Con­gress in 1972, the adherents of extension fought for one of 3~ years. Several bills in the House and Senate had varying success but none could gain the assent of both bodies. In general, the bills made their case upon leaving as little work for the Court of Claims as possible, eliminating delay, and keeping Congress closely informed. 
The result ofthe division on the future ofthe Com­mission was a Congressional compromise on an administration bill allowing an 18-month extension. Public Law 94-46.5 was passed on October 8, 1976.

This act extended the life of the Commission to Sep­tember 30, 1978, and provided (1) that, no later than December 31, 1976, the Commission would certify and transfer to the Court of Claims all cases it deter­mined it could not finish by September 30, 1978, 
(2) 
that, at any time prior to September 30, 1978, the Commission could transfer other cases, and 

(3) 
that all unfinished cases would be transferred to the Court of Claims on September 30, 1978. 


With its end firmly in sight, the Commission con­tinued its work and attempted to fulfill its mandate to lighten its remaining caseload. By September 1976 it had disposed of 474 dockets and had 141 pending; 16 of these were on appeal before the Court of Claims. Before the deadline of December 31, 1976, it transferred 20 cases to the Court that it had deter­mined could not be completed before 1978. As of January I, 1977, the Commission had 21 months left to complete some 120 dockets, though one-quarter of these were accounting cases which would surely be transferred. 
The Commission on January 1, 1978, had 102 dockets remaining and a fair chance at leaving a man­ageable remnant to the Court of Claims. The Court had secured a law in July of 1977 (P.L. 9.5-69) to de­fine more precisely the transference of claims and increase its staffand was prepared to take over from the Commission. Less than 68 dockets remained undisposed by September 1978, and the prospect for their final resolution by the Court of Claims within the hoped for 5 years seemed good. 
Conclusion 
The process of Indian claims resolution has been a lengthy one and the Indian Claims Commission was simply an element of that process. Very few of the legal issues of Indian history have progressed to a point where a conclusion can be written to them. The legal history of Indian claims is certainly not one of these few. The Commission may terminate but, in spite of the Congressional mandate that Indian claims arising prior to 1946 also terminate, they will persist. 
The future of the debate on land claims rests now in a more searching examination of the treaties and the intent of both participants. It also lies in how far the Indians are able to push their claims for land and how far the United States is willing to acknowledge them. Between these contending positions the treaties will be interpreted or reinterpreted, or even revoked, as the ripening climate ofAmerican opinion allows it to happen.

Considering its limitations, the Commission had several positive effects. For one, some tribes have used their share of the $800 million in awards wisely and aided their economies. Secondly, others have hired full-time legal counsel to serve their ongoing interests. The Commission, with its extended tenure, has greatly raised the "legal consciousness" of the tribes. Thirdly, large segments of American society, in public and private life, have con­comitantly had their own consciousness raised con­cerning Indians, reservations, and the tribal relation to the American Government via the ancient but active treaties. Fourth, the ethno-historical research findings amassed as a by-product ofthe Commission Act constitute an unprecedented source for the study ofIndian-white relations. The tribes now have the satisfaction that their side of American History 
has finally been told with voluminous documenta·· tion. Lastly, the process of the Commission's work, over 3 decades, has brought the many tribes together in one cause and given them a cause for unity that they have rarely had. These are not minor accom­plishments. 
The last question that needs an answer is did the Indians gain "their day in court?" The answer is yes. The Commission was a court, complete with appelate review. And it was unique among courts in its jurisdiction over "moral claims" and having no statute oflimitations except the requirement that the claims must have accrued prior to 1946. The tribes, 
represented by some of the best legal talent in the 
country, litigated more than .500 claims and won 
awards on over 60 percent of them. 
This struggle for perpetuating Indian culture and settling tribal claims has run through American history for almost 150 years. Possibly it will continue for another century or until America finds an accom­modation with these internal wards. There is no easy solution to this problem, or maybe no solution at all. For, at best, the existence of a tribal society within the borders of a highly individualistic and technical culture is tenuous. It is not that the tribal society materially threatens the technological way of life, but that it presents a moral threat to settled myths. It keeps an unpleasant past alive and presents chal­lenging questions for the future. Perhaps it is time to appreciate that the triumphs of the frontier period were mitigated by the sordid dealings with the Indians. "To dust off and to pour over these old 
account books might show us what investments to avoid in the future. That would certainly be one path evening the balance of the future, though the debits offormer errors will remain forever old debts beyond reparations, atonement or forgiveness. "97 The Indian Claims Commission went a long step in this direction but could offer only money. Other remedies to the unresolved problems between the Government and the Indians may now be found.

Index to the Map 
Indian Land Areas Judicially Established 

Introduction * 
For scores of years, American Indian tribes have 
been litigating claims against the United States 
Government, seeking damages for various categories 
of wrongs done them. Perhaps the most common 
type of claim has been that land owned by an Indian 
tribe under the doctrine of "Indian title" was taken 
from the tribe without adequate compensation being 
paid. One step in a tribe's proving such a claim is 
demonstrating that a particular tract was indeed 
owned by it by Indian title: that the tribe had 
exclusively occupied and used a tract for a long 
time. The "Indian Land Areas Judicially Established" 
map summarizes the results of all such successful 
claims and depicts the tracts to which Indian owner­
ship was established through a judicial proceeding. 
Thus the map joins two themes: the first that of 
Indian history, showing where the various tribes 
were originally located, and the second that ofIndian 
legal history, where the reality of Indian history has 
been filtered through an Anglo-Saxon adversary judicial process. 1 
A. Indian Claims: The Judicial Process 
The legal rule has always been that the United States as a sovereign cannot be sued without its consent, and that consent has not been freely given in our history. The United States Court of Claims was established in 1855 as a general forum before which citizens could present claims against the 
"This introduction was prepared by Richard W. Yarborough. Commissioner, who also edited the map and directed the compilation of data for it, and accepts responsi­bility for any errors that may occur Compiling the data for the Indian Claims Com·· mission were J. William Nutter, Laurence A Davis, Deputy Counsels, Donald Hyde, Senior Attorney, Harmon S. Maxson, Kathleen A McKee, James Roberson, former staff attorneys, Consultant: Guy M. Lovell, Bureau of Indian Affairs (ret.) 
The tracts were bounded and colored by John E. Roberts, Cartographer, Bureau of'Land Management The map was compiled and produced by the US. Geological Survey 
1Any mapping of' Indian lands must draw on the results of the prodigious industry of Charles C. Royce. His massive compilation. published as Indian l.and Cessions in the United States, 18th Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology, Part 2 (1899), depicts on a series of maps the Indian lands ceded piece by piece by the many Indian treaties of cession. His translation of the often·vague treaty calls into precise boundaries created an indispensable reference for all subsequent students of Indian land areas; many "Royce Areas" will be found intact on this map 
Thus mapping the cessions, however, is a subtractive process. and often the cession did not match the true ownership of the land, This map is a positive expression of land determined to have been owned. without special reference to the cession or extinguishment process The area numbers on this map do not correspond to the Royce Area numbers 
United States, but its jurisdiction was limited and specifically excluded Indian tribes as litigants. Over the years some Indian tribes made compelling argu­ments to Congress that their claims demanded justice. Individual jurisdictional acts were passed allowing named tribes to sue the United States in the Court of Claims on causes defined in the statute. 2 Some of these acts were drafted broadly enough to allow claims based on loss of Indian title lands, and resulted in decisions defining the extent of a tribe's lands.3 These results are mapped here. 
Eventually the volume and variety of requests to Congress for special jurisdictional acts became so great that in 1946 Congress devised a general solu­tion: the Indian Claims Commission. 4 This became the forum to receive all Indian tribal claims accruing before 1946. Many of the claims filed were for com­pensation for Indian title lands lost by treaty or otherwise, and thus began a large volume of litigation to prove the one-time existence ofthe tribes' Indian title to the appropriate tracts. In general, the cases proceeded by the attorneys for the parties (the Indian tribe on one side and the U.S. Department of Justice on the other) presenting, at a trial before the Commission, the testimony of expert witnesses such as anthropologists, historians, and ethnohis­torians. The witnesses' often-differing opinions as to tribal locations and their extent were reconciled by the Commission in its decision announcing what had been proved, and delineating the boundaries of the Indian title tract.5

The decisions have also been collected and issued in a micro­fiche format by the Clearwater Publishing Co., Inc. 1995 Broadway, New York, NY., 10023, which firm has also issued microfiche collections of the expert testimony delivered before the Commission, and the legal briefs filed there.

It was not firmly established until 19.5.5 that Indian 
title lands could form the basis for compensation 
under the Indian Claims Commission Act, but that 
category ofcase carne to provide probably the largest 
part of the Commission's business,,6 By 1978, the 
final year of the Commission, decisions in cases 
requiring a finding of Indian title had been entered 
in every such claim filed before the Commission, 
and the results are mapped here. In that respect 
the Commission's work and the map of Indian 
Land Areas Judicially Established are complete. 7 
Each map area enclosed by a solid line represents 
a case, usually a docket of the Indian Claims Com­
mission, with an identification number referenced to 
this Index. A dashed line around an area is used 
when the case was settled favorably to the plaintiffs 
before exact boundaries were established. S 
B. Indian Title 
However often ignored in practice, the legal doctrineofeveryEuropean colonizer ofthe Americas acknowledged that the Indians had certain rights to the peaceful possession of their land. England acknowledged such Indian rights, and in general her American colonies expanded through purchase of lands from the tribe claiming them. 9 The United States took no different view, and Chief Justice John Marshall firmly nailed the doctrine of Indian title into American Constitutional law. 10 
Indian title, original Indian title, or aboriginal title refers to the possessory right of an Indian tribe to occupy and use the area ofland it has traditionally used,u It is conceived ofas a title superior to all but the sovereign; neither settler nor state could take it away.12 However, the United States as sovereign is deemed to have the power to extinguish or terminate

Indian title at will. 13 An Indian title is held not to be properly protected against confiscation without just compensation by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. 14 
It must be observed that Indian title as used in our legal system is completely a creation of our legal system, and American Indians may properly dis­claim having had any choice in creating .it or defining it. Indian title as developed in the American courts is a very rough compromise between a system oftitIes dependent on written instruments and surveyed lines and a system that in simpler times may well have r~jected the notion that land can be "owned" at all. 15 
Three factual elements appear in the usual formu­lation of the requirements for proving a valid Indian title: the extent of the use and occupancy, the exclusiveness ofthe use and occupancy, and whether the use continued "for a long time." Since a title that is based on use alone might at its most expansive be argued to give a tribe title to all land that any member of the tribe had ever wandered over, these elements provide some focus for sorting out what is one tribe's rather than another's. The extent of the use and occupancy usually coincides with what is shown to be the area used for subsistence by all the members of the tribe. 16 Not only agricultural use, but religious use, hunting and gathering use, even sporadic irregular hunting use, may, if not in con­flict with another tribe's use, bring an area within the compass of a tribe's Indian title lands.1 7 
At some time or another a particular tract may have seen members of more than one tribe hunting over it. Our legal prejudices have strained at allowing there to be "ownership" of an area apparently free for use by all. Therefore, a tribe asserting Indian title must show exclusive use: that the tract was its alone. IS The tribe does not have to show formal political hegemony over an area, or assertion and exercise of power to exclude all members of other 
13"Extinguishment of Indian title based on aboriginal possession is of course a dif­ferent matter. The power of Congress in that regard is supreme. The manner. method and time of such extinguishment raise political not justiciable issues. Buttz v Northern P R, Co,. supra. As stated by Chief Justice Marshall in Johnson v. Jf'lnrosh. supra, 'the exclusive right of the United States to extinguish' Indian title has never been doubted And \\hether it be done by treaty, by the ,sword, by pur­chase, by the exercise of complete dominion adverse to the right of occupancy, or otherwise. its justness is not open to inquiry in the courts, Beecher v.

tribes. Usually a more intensive and persistent use of an area as compared to a casual and incidental use by another tribe will be sufficient for Indian title.19 Raiding into a tribe's Indian title area will not defeat its title, nor will its raids create title. 20 A tribe may permit guests to use its lands without defeating its title.21 But since often the only evidence of title is the observation of use by individual Indians, common use tends to defeat title" The decisions have not looked with favor on agruments that common use implies ajoint ownership.22 Joint Indian title by two or more tribes is a theoretical possibility, and has been discovered once,23 but mere common use allows too many other inferences to be drawn (owner? guest? passing through?) to allow title to be decreed in one tribe or the other or both. From the map, one may observe that this requirement seems often to have led to the finding of "buffer zones" between tribes, while in other cases the evidence has allowed the drawing of more precise boundaries. 
Indian title also requires use of the area "for a long time." The decisions reflect an unwillingness to find ownership of a specific tract in a nomadic tribe wandering over many areas; some degree of continuous association with an area has been required. However, no example comes to mind of a tribe so nomadic that it was denied having Indian title lands located somewhere.24 Perhaps 20 to 50 years seems judicially acceptable as "a long time" under appropriate circumstances.25 
C. Indian vs. Recognized Title 
Along with the power of Congress to terminate Indian title at will goes the power of Congress to invest a tribe with a more secure title. When Congress by treaty or statute acknowledged that a particular tract belonged to a certain tribe, a "recognized" or "reservation" title was created giving that tribe a full beneficial interest as private property protected by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.26 Com­monly the Indian treaties provided for a cession of

a tribe's Indian title lands and confirmed to it a smaller tract as a reservation, within or without the former Indian title lands. 27 This map does not attempt to chart the diminished reservations created in that manner, but does show large areas of land judged to be held by recognized title where the tracts were originally occupied by the tribes as in Indian title. 
Some treaties negotiated with Indian tribes promised large areas not ceded by the treaty would be left to the tribes as "their permanent home." (Of course, cessions later were obtained of most such areas when the tides of settlers seemed to require it.) Courts later concluded that such treaties created recognized title to the unceded areas, but sometimes which tribe owned which tract could only be determined by subsequent treaties of cession. Three such treaties affecting large areas were the Treaty ofGreeneville in 1795 (lands in the Old North­west),28 the Treaty ofPrairie du Chien in 1825 (Sioux and Chippewa lands in the upper Mississippi area),29 and the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1851 (Northern Great Plains).30 The great advantage to those tribes as litigants was that their aboriginal use of every quarter of the claimed area did not have to be proved as in an Indian title case.31 
These areas have been included in this map since they are the areas oforiginal occupancy ofthe tribes. Even though mapping these areas derogates the purity of concept of having an "Indian Title Map," it is necessary to show the existence of considerable Indian lands (and legal activity involving large areas of the United States) based on the original homes of the tribes. 
The treaties involving these areas of recognized title often took cessions from two or more tribes, acknowledged occupants as well as any possible claimants. The result was to create areas of joint title, and judicial problems in sorting out the extent of the interests of the tribes.32 The striping on the map is used to portray such joint title areas, with the stripes applied so as to indicate the approximate proportional ownership of each tribe. 
One large tract, Area 53, is distinctively striped 
to indicate that title to that tract has been found 
independently to be in the Potawatomi and in the

D. Tribal Names 
The tribal names shown on the map are those, 
sometimes in shortened form, of the original tribal 
owners of the land. This name may differ from the 
present-day reservation name of the plaintiffs who 
brought the suit and under whose name the case will 
be styled.34 
Some tribal names were placed on the map even though those tribes, for one reason or another, did not ever receive an Indian title adjudication. Their selection was somewhat arbitrary but was designed to show the general original location of tribes prominent in the literature, legal and otherwise. 
All the tracts ofa single tribe have the same color, but similarly named tribes may have different colors assigned if they were distinct land-owning entities. 
"Compare Emigrant Ne~ York Indians v United States. 5 Ind. CI Comm. 560 (1957). atrd 177 Ct CI. 263 (1966) and Prairie Band of POllawatomie Indian, v. United States, 28 Ind.. CI Comm. 454 (1972) 
3tThe tribe or band is usually conceived of as the land·-owning entity in whose name the suit is prosecuted, but no one rationale wiU explain all the cases. An aboriginal entity based on kinship, an entity created by a treaty. or an entity created by forcible placement on a reservation mayan be found as plaintiffs in the cases. Perhaps the most unusual situation is that of the Indians of California (Area J18) comprising most of the many smaJltribes of that state. The holding that this entity is an "other identifi­able group" entitled to present a land claim rests mostly on a history ofprevious Iitiga·· lion as a group. Thompson v.. United States. 122 Ct. CI 348 (1952) This claim waS settled before other tracts lhan those shown on the map were defined 
However, the lands of the Potawatomi, Chippewa, Sioux and Apache were each given the same color throughout regardless of the legal distinctness ofthe component entities. Otherwise, the colors were assigned arbitrarily and no relationship is implied be­tweentracts ofthe samecolorexceptwhereadjacent. 
E. Dates 
Often the homeland of a tribe would shift over time. Every area mapped here is tied to a specific date, given in the Index, when that area was the tribe's by Indian title. The date usually coincides with the time when any of the title was first extinguished, by treaty of cession or otherwise. In general, the dates increase from east to west at the pace the country was settled. 
F. Citations 
The citations given in the Index are to the title decisions only: the phase of an Indian Claims Com­mission case where the boundaries of the owned land are determined. Other indexes must be used to trace the full legal history of the cases and find the ultimate results. 
G. Other Map Features 
A selection of prominent treaty sites and forts are located on the map for reference purposes and the convenience of the reader.
