Playing with GNU Makefiles

# This Makefile is designed to clean up OCR in the Final Report of the Indian Claims Commission. #


 It is mostly an attempt to play with the capabilities of GNU Make as it relates to reproducible research.
 It will find and replace all instances of _'Dkt'_ and replace with _'Docket'_ because 'Dkt' appears prominently in the word cloud of the OCR'd ICC Final Report file. The corrected source is copied in a correct-source directory with the timestamp added to the footer.
